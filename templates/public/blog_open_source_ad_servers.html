<h2>Why Use an Open Source Ad Server?</h2>
<p>Open source ad servers give publishers and developers full control over how ads are delivered, tracked, and
    optimized. Unlike closed commercial platforms, you can customize features, self-host, and avoid expensive licensing
    fees.</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Revive Adserver</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.revive-adserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Revive Adserver</a> is one of the most
    widely used open source ad servers. It supports banner rotation, campaign targeting, and detailed statistics. While
    powerful, it requires more setup and server resources.</p>

<ul>
    <li>‚úÖ Mature project with community support</li>
    <li>‚úÖ Advanced campaign features</li>
    <li>‚ùå Heavier setup compared to lightweight tools</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>2. Ad Preview Tester (Lightweight & Free)</h2>
<p><strong>Ad Preview Tester</strong> is not a full ad server, but a lightweight <em>open source demo tool</em> for
    previewing HTML5 banners in standard formats. It includes impression and click tracking, making it ideal for
    developers who need a fast way to test creatives or simulate ad placements.</p>

<h2>3. DFP Alternatives (Self-Hosted Clones)</h2>
<p>Several open source projects try to replicate functionality from platforms like Google Ad Manager (formerly DFP).
    They usually focus on header bidding, programmatic auctions, or custom reporting. These are evolving but often less
    stable than Revive.</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Keitaro Tracker</h2>
<p><a href="https://keitaro.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Keitaro</a> is technically a tracker but often used as a
    lightweight ad server. It allows A/B testing, traffic distribution, and campaign reporting. While not fully free, it
    has strong open community support and self-host options.</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. Custom Solutions (Built with Modern Frameworks)</h2>
<p>Many teams now roll their own ad serving layers with modern frameworks like FastAPI, Django, or Node.js. With a
    database like PostgreSQL and libraries for analytics, developers can create tailored solutions. Tools like
    <strong>Ad Preview Tester</strong> demonstrate how easy it is to bootstrap an ad server for testing purposes.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In 2025, <strong>Revive Adserver</strong> remains the most complete open source ad server, but lightweight options
    like <strong>Ad Preview Tester</strong> fill an important gap for developers and marketers who need quick previews
    and basic tracking. Depending on your use case, you can choose between enterprise-grade flexibility or lightweight
    simplicity.</p>
