<h2>Why Display Ads Still Work in 2026</h2>
<p>Display advertising remains one of the most accessible and reliable ways to monetize a website. Unlike affiliate marketing or selling products, display ads generate passive income from your existing traffic. Whether you run a blog, a tool, or a content site, banner ads can provide a steady revenue stream with minimal effort.</p>

<p>In 2026, the global display advertising market is worth over $200 billion, and publishers of all sizes can participate. The key is understanding how to set up ads correctly, choose the right networks, and optimize for maximum revenue.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step 1: Choose the Right Ad Network</h2>
<p>The ad network you choose determines how much you earn per impression (CPM) and per click (CPC). Here are the top options for publishers:</p>

<h3>Google AdSense</h3>
<p>The most popular ad network, Google AdSense is easy to set up and works well for sites with moderate traffic. It offers contextual ads that match your content, which can improve click-through rates.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Best for: Blogs and content sites with 1,000+ monthly visitors</li>
    <li>Average CPM: $1-5 depending on niche</li>
    <li>Minimum payout: $100</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adsterra</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.adsterra.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adsterra</a> is a high-performance ad network that supports multiple ad formats including banner ads, popunders, and native ads. It offers competitive CPM rates and accepts publishers with any traffic volume.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Best for: All traffic levels, especially international traffic</li>
    <li>Average CPM: $0.50-10 depending on geo</li>
    <li>Minimum payout: $5</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ezoic</h3>
<p>Ezoic uses AI to optimize ad placement automatically. It works best for sites with at least 10,000 monthly visits and can significantly increase revenue compared to manual ad placement.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Best for: Sites with 10,000+ monthly visitors</li>
    <li>Average CPM: $5-15</li>
    <li>Minimum payout: $20</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Select the Best Ad Sizes</h2>
<p>Not all banner sizes perform equally. Based on industry data, here are the highest-performing IAB standard ad sizes:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Size</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Best Placement</th>
            <th>CTR Performance</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>728x90</td>
            <td>Leaderboard</td>
            <td>Above the fold, header</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>300x250</td>
            <td>Medium Rectangle</td>
            <td>In-content, sidebar</td>
            <td>Highest</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>336x280</td>
            <td>Large Rectangle</td>
            <td>In-content</td>
            <td>High</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>160x600</td>
            <td>Wide Skyscraper</td>
            <td>Sidebar</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>320x50</td>
            <td>Mobile Leaderboard</td>
            <td>Mobile header/footer</td>
            <td>High (mobile)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <strong>300x250 Medium Rectangle</strong> consistently outperforms other sizes because it fits naturally within content and attracts attention without being intrusive.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Optimize Ad Placement</h2>
<p>Where you place ads on your page has a bigger impact on revenue than which ad network you use. Follow these proven placement strategies:</p>

<h3>Above the Fold</h3>
<p>Place your highest-performing ad (usually 728x90 Leaderboard) at the top of the page, visible without scrolling. This position gets the most impressions and highest viewability.</p>

<h3>In-Content</h3>
<p>Place a 300x250 ad between paragraphs of your content. Readers naturally encounter these ads while reading, which leads to higher engagement and click-through rates.</p>

<h3>After Content</h3>
<p>When readers finish an article, they are looking for what to do next. An ad placed after the last paragraph catches this decision moment.</p>

<h3>Sticky Sidebar</h3>
<p>A 160x600 or 300x250 ad that scrolls with the user keeps the ad visible throughout the reading experience. This dramatically increases viewability and CPM.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step 4: Monitor and Optimize</h2>
<p>Monetization is not a set-and-forget process. Track these key metrics weekly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mille):</strong> Revenue per 1,000 impressions. Higher is better.</li>
    <li><strong>CTR (Click-Through Rate):</strong> Percentage of users who click ads. Industry average is 0.1-0.5%.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewability:</strong> Percentage of ads actually seen by users. Aim for 70%+.</li>
    <li><strong>RPM (Revenue Per Mille):</strong> Total revenue per 1,000 page views. This is your bottom line metric.</li>
</ul>

<p>A/B test different ad positions, sizes, and networks. Even small improvements in CTR can significantly increase monthly revenue.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Too many ads:</strong> More than 3-4 ads per page hurts user experience and can lower your SEO rankings.</li>
    <li><strong>Ads below the fold only:</strong> If users need to scroll to see your ads, most impressions are wasted.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring mobile:</strong> Over 60% of web traffic is mobile. Use responsive ad units.</li>
    <li><strong>Not testing:</strong> What works for one site may not work for another. Always test.</li>
    <li><strong>Blocking ad blockers:</strong> Instead, focus on creating content so valuable that users whitelist your site.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monetizing your website with display ads is straightforward when you follow the right approach. Choose a reputable ad network, use proven ad sizes, optimize placement for visibility, and continuously test and improve.</p>

<p>Start with 2-3 well-placed ads, track your metrics, and scale up as your traffic grows. With consistent effort, display advertising can become a reliable income stream for your website.</p>
